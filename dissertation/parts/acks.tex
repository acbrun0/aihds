\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I want to thank Luís Silva for accompanying me throughout this project. You were always ready to help, your guidance was indispensable and your "let's go" attitude to new ideas was always encouraging. I also want to thank Patrick Grumer for the permanent availability and willingness to help, especially in the latter stages of this endeavour. Furthermore, a thank you to everyone at Continental Engineering Services Porto for allowing me to take a step into the automotive world.\par

I also want to thank Professor José Carlos Bacelar for taking on this new project on an unfamiliar subject, for asking all the right questions and for the editorial help which was vital to producing this document.\par

I thank my friends for always making me laugh and making me live through all the good things in life.

A special thanks to my girlfriend, Sílvia, for always motivating me to keep pushing towards achieving my goals and for listening to me talk about all my ideas. I could not have done it without you.\par

Finally, I want to thank my family for all the support whatever my decisions were. You are the reason ended up being who I am.
