Many intra-vehicle \gls{ids} approaches have been published, as shown in \ref{subsec:can_ids}, but they have mostly relied on a few labelled datasets, such as \cite{CANDataset_Car-Hacking}. Here, the proposed system aims to be an \gls{ids} based on unsupervised machine learning for anomaly detection that makes decisions based on the statistical and information-theoretic characteristics of network traffic gathered in real-time. In other words, the system is able to learn what constitutes normal traffic, and signal when it detects behaviour that it considers to be novel. This would allow manufacturers to deploy the \gls{ids} in a plug-and-play fashion, without having to tune it for every different configuration of the vehicle.
